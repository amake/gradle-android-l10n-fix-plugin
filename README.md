# Gradle Android L10N Fix Plugin

This plugin provides solutions for the [compile-time and runtime language
resource contamination
problems](https://gist.github.com/amake/0ac7724681ac1c178c6f95a5b09f03ce) that
break display-language fallback according to user preferences on Android 7 and
later.

## What?

Starting in Android 7, instead of choosing a single language for the user
interface, you can set a priority list of languages. Let's say you chose:

1. Spanish
2. Italian
3. English

Now consider an app that supports both Italian and English. With your preferred
languages set to the above, the OS knows to show it to you in Italian rather
than English. This is display-language fallback.

This mechanism can be broken in two different ways. For more details see
[Correct localization on Android
7](https://gist.github.com/amake/0ac7724681ac1c178c6f95a5b09f03ce).

## Do I need this?

- Does your app run on Android 7 or 7.1.1 (SDK 24 or 25)?
- Does your app support more than one display language?
- Do you use the AppCompat library? Any Google Play Services libraries? Anything
  else with its own language resources in languages you don't support?
- Do you use
  [WebView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView.html)
  at all?

If so, your app probably suffers from [language resource
contamination](https://gist.github.com/amake/0ac7724681ac1c178c6f95a5b09f03ce),
which prevents some users from seeing the app in their preferred language.

Go check how many localizations Google thinks you support on the Google Play Console:

Surprised?

You can also check your APK directly yourself. Here's the result for the default
new project template app created by Android Studio 3.1:

```
$ ./gradlew assemble

## How does it work?

### Compile-time contamination fix

The compile-time fix works by inspecting your `res` folder hierarchy to detect
what locales your app supports, and filters out unwanted locales by setting the
appropriate
[`resConfig`](https://google.github.io/android-gradle-dsl/current/com.android.build.gradle.internal.dsl.ProductFlavor.html#com.android.build.gradle.internal.dsl.ProductFlavor:resConfig%28java.lang.String%29)
filters.

This is essentially a reimplementation of `resConfig 'auto'`, which was
[deprecated in Android Gradle Plugin
3.1](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/tools/base/+/6b7799c36f1ba5194f73f5c14a7b0365a8428714%5E%21/)
due to issues with multi-module projects and `aar` libraries. This plugin
addresses some of the issues, but not all. If your project uses internal
libraries in `aar` form, see [Limitations](#limitations) for important
information.

### Runtime contamination fix

The plugin offers two facilities for dealing with runtime resource contamination
from e.g. referencing the Chrome-based
[WebView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView.html)
class:

- `L10nFixActivity`: An `Activity` class that ensures that only supported
  locales are held by its base context. This is needed to keep locales correct
  after configuration changes such as device rotation.
- `L10nUtil`: A utility class offering static methods for dealing with supported
  locales, most importantly:
  - `fixLocales(Resources)`: Call this on your activity's resources immediately
    after referencing `WebView` to restore the correct locales.

The above features are backed by `BuildConfig.SUPPORTED_LOCALES`, an array of
supported locales generated from the information collected for the compile-time
contamination fix.

## Requirements

Gradle must be invoked with Java 8 (your app need not use Java 8 language
features).

## Usage

1. Add the plugin to your root project
   ([instructions](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.madlonkay.android-l10n-fix))
2. Apply the plugin to your Android projects. These are any projects to which
   a `com.android.*` plugin is applied.
    ```
    apply plugin: 'com.madlonkay.android-l10n-fix'
    ```
   This activates the compile-time fix. Note:
    - This plugin should be applied *after* the Android plugin
    - Apply this plugin to all Android projects that have locale-specific
      resources
3. (Optional) Configure the plugin with a `l10n` block. See below for options.
4. To activate the runtime fix:
   1. Make your `Activity` classes extend `L10nFixActivity`
   2. Anywhere you first reference the `WebView` class (loading a layout
      containing a `WebView`, using any `WebView` static methods), immediately
      afterwards call `L10nUtil.fixLocales(getResources())`

## Configuration

In the same project you applied the plugin to:

```
l10n {
    defaultLocale = 'en'
}
```

Options:

- `defaultLocale`: The locale for "default" resources (i.e. in `values`, not
  `values-XX`). This defaults to `en`.

## Limitations

An Android Studio Team member described the [reason for removing `resConfig
'auto'`](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/8eb8vm/android_gradle_plugin_31x_commit_history/dy09tv1/)
as such:

> `auto` only looked at the app module to figure out what to package instead of
> all your sub-modules. So if you have a very empty app module (say no UI
> strings in there), and all your UI in sub-modules, then the packaging would be
> wrong.
>
> Even if we made this work, it's impossible to know whether remote dependencies
> (consumed via `aar`) were part of your own code or were 3rd party
> libraries. (some companies publish their own shared code as `aar` via internal
> repos)
>
> So the issue is what should we consider to be yours vs not yours and how to
> make this work 100% reliably.
>
> Ultimately the most reliable way to make this work is for the dev to
> explicitly list what resource to include.

This plugin does correctly handle multiple modules, but it cannot address the
`aar` issue. It considers `aar`s to be "not yours", so if you have internally
developed `aar`s that contain language resources not otherwise detectable, you
should manually list those in `resConfigs` as officially recommended *in your
main app's `defaultConfig`*.
